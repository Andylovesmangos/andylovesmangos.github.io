    Welcome all! <br><br>&emsp;I am a senior at the University of Maryland graduating in May 2022. 
    I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Linguistics minor.
<br><br>&emsp;
    Even before I moved to Taiwan when I was 7, I have always messed around with computers. Although a lot of that was playing video games, problems and glitches would naturally arise.
    At a young age, I was exposed to the type of problem-solving and research that is paramount in science, specifically Computer Science and programming. When I first started programming 
    at the start of high school, I experienced a brand-new way of problem-solving, through design, innovation, and ultimately coding. <br><br>&emsp;More recently, I have taken up a Linguistics minor. Coming from a 
    multilingual background, I had always been fascinated with language. So it was eye-opening for me to study Linguistics and find it so interesting and applicable to our lives. More specifically, however, I 
    drew parallels between completely different topics in Linguistics and Computer Science. Things like syntax, semantics, etc. would naturally be represented by data structures like in CompSci.
    This is what drives my current personal interest of Natural Language Procesing and Computational Linguistics; however, I also love developing software as a programmer. I hope to take my passion and 
    skills and apply them in order to learn and grow even more. Thanks for reading, and feel free to check around my site!
