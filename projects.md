<li> <h1> <a href="https://github.com/Andylovesmangos/andylovesmangos.github.io"> This Site! </a> </h1> </li>
This site is hosted on github pages, and built using jekyll, a static-site generator. Check out how this site was set up. I did not use a template which is common, and instead made most of the pages (with greater ease thanks to jekyll though).
  
<li> <h1> <a href="https://andylovesmangos.github.io/assets/images/Press_Release.pdf"> Affordable Project </a> </h1> </li>
A software engineering project for the non-profit organization Affordable during my time in CMSC435 (<a href="https://seam.cs.umd.edu/">Software Engineering</a>).
